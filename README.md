Managing patient records, scheduling appointments, tracking treatment histories, and handling billing are everyday challenges for dental clinics — especially when relying on outdated paper-based systems or spreadsheets. These legacy methods often lead to data inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities.

To solve these issues, we present the Dentica Management System — a modern, streamlined solution designed to centralize and simplify clinic operations. Dentica offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform to help dental clinics deliver better service while optimizing their internal workflows.


## Features

- Patient Management: CRUDL operations for patient data management.
- Appointment Scheduling: Automated booking, rescheduling, and cancellation features.
- Treatment History Management: Comprehensive tracking of treatment details linked to appointments.
- Billing & Payment Management: Automated bill generation, payment processing, and financial record keeping.
- Reports & Analytics: Real-time reporting capabilities to drive insights into clinic operations.
- User Authentication: Role-based access control (with the dentist as the primary user and receptionist as a secondary user) to ensure secure system access.
